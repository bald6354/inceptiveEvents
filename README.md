# Inceptive/Trailing Events for Neuromorphic Cameras
Faster implementation of Inceptive and Trailing Events for Neuromorphic Cameras. This is a temporal-only denoising algorithm for event camera data.

For more information please see the paper: Baldwin, R. Wes, et al. "Inceptive Event Time-Surfaces for Object Classification Using Neuromorphic Cameras."
